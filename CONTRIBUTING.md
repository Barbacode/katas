# CONTRIBUTION GUIDELINES

We do a code kata each month in the [Barbacode space]: http://barbacode.space

If you want to share the implementation you have done for the kata, you can do it here! Just open a Pull Request and put your code inside a folder with your name inside the correct kata folder.

### Please, ensure you include only your code. Don't include external packages or third party repositories.
